# FYP- IoT: Smart Automated home system
This project aims to design and implement a more cost-effective digital door lock. It
will take form in a digital facial recognition door lock, and it is designed to have a low energy
consumption and an integrated supply of energy. The IoT-enabled home system consists of
raspberry pi, a camera, and a servomotor.\
Furthermore, the system will be designed to seamlessly integrate with smartphones through a
distinctive mobile application, providing users with a user-friendly interface for control and
monitoring
